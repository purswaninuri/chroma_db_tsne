Jupyter Notebook: Analyzing Clothing Reviews with ChromaDB & OpenAI Embeddings

This project is part of an Unstructured Project from the DataCamp AI Engineer Track. It demonstrates how to use ChromaDB for categorizing clothing-related reviews using OpenAI Embeddings and semantic similarity queries.

Key highlights of this project:

ChromaDB for Vector Search: Storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently.
OpenAI Embeddings: Converting text into high-dimensional vectors.
Topic Categorization: Assigning reviews to predefined topics based on similarity.
TSNE for 2D Visualization: Projecting high-dimensional embeddings into a visual format.
Recommendation System: Identifying similar topics based on user reviews.
This repository showcases how vector databases, embeddings, and dimensionality reduction can be applied to real-world text data analysis.
